# Case Study-Smart Watch
Description-Wearable devices like Smart Watches Can perform Multiple functions like     
Fitness tracking, Steps counting and can perform most of the functions that a mobile     
Phone can do.
    
    
# High Level Requirements
-To provide an interface to the user to interact and display time and provide apps 
-To provide Bluetooth Connectivity to connect it to mobile phone
-To make the watch portable by providing with battery and charger
-To Sense Temperature and Pressure

# Low Level Requirements
-An Interface is provided to the user by capacitive touch screen and android operating    
 System.
-Bluetooth Connectivity is provided to the user by inbuilt module in SOC
-A suitable battery to power the watch and size of battery is taken care.
-Temperature, Pressure etc are sensed by those particular sensors and a module to 
Convert anlog to digital values is installed in system on chip .digital to analog is 
Built in system on chip for drivers such as LED and Vibration motors.

# Component Description
*System on chip-All the necessary functions required for the application is integrated     
 On a single chip. Modern controllers such as the PSoC integrate sophisticated analog                              
and programmable digital functionality in a single chip, along with an ARM cortex-M 
core, utilizing the power of the ARM architecture.
*Power Management circuit is implemented
*Sensors-Motion Sensors-Accelerometer,Magnetometer,Gyroscope ,Temperature 
and pressure sensors are used
*Motors and LEDs are used as ouput drives.
